	abstract = {The paper provides an ex-post analysis of the determinants of within-country regional heterogeneity of the labour market impact of {COVID}-19. By focussing on the first wave of the pandemic in the four largest euro area economies, it finds that the propagation of the economic impact across regions cannot be explained by the spread of infections only. Instead, a region’s economic structure is a significant driver of the observed heterogeneity. Moreover, our results suggest that a region's trade relations, both within and across countries, represent a relevant indirect channel through which {COVID}-19 related disruptions affect regional economic activity. In this regard, the analysis depicts vulnerabilities arising from potential disruptions of the highly integrated {EU} supply chains. {JEL} Classification: R11, F14, J40, R15},

The striking spatial unevenness of {COVID}-19 suggests that the infection has hit economic core locations harder, and this raises questions about whether, and how, the subnational geography of the disease is connected to the economic base of localities. We provide some first evidence consistent with the possibility that the local specialization in geographically concentrated economic activities acts as a vehicle of disease transmission. This could generate a core-periphery pattern in the spatiality of {COVID}-19, which might follow the lines of the local economic landscape and the tradability of its outputs.},

	abstract = {The increasing number of economic shocks and disruptions and their highly heterogeneous territorial impacts reopened the debate on the ability of regions to withstand and recover from exogenous shocks. This paper focuses on the recessionary impact of the 2008 global financial economic crisis. It empirically explores the relationship between pre-crisis spatial connectivity and economic resilience across European Union ({EU}) regions over the 2008–2015 period. The empirical analysis is performed on a sample of 1312 {NUTS}-3 regions in 25 countries. Standard, spatial and multilevel hierarchical regression models are applied to investigate the effect of spatial connectivity and other pre-crisis determinants on regional economic resilience across three geographical scales: national, {NUTS}-2 regional and {NUTS}-3 regional. The results show that accessibility is an important factor for {EU} {NUTS}-3 regions to build resilience capabilities to exogenous shocks. Our findings demonstrate that higher accessibility is associated with greater regional economic resilience. The model results indicate a positive effect of migration and a negative effect of the ageing population on regional reaction to the crisis. Our analysis highlights the importance of country effects and spatial spillover effects on the ability of regions to shape resilience capabilities.},

At the conceptual level, there is the need to identify resilient actions, including those that may seem to violate established norms, such as rational behavior. At the operational level, it may be difficult to model individual, group, and community behavior in a single framework. At the empirical level, it is especially difficult to gather data on resilience to specify models. The purpose of this paper is to summarize progress on all three planes. First, defines several important dimensions of economic resilience to disasters. Second, shows how computable general equilibrium modeling represents a useful framework for analyzing the behavior of individuals, businesses, and markets. Third, summarizes recent progress in the conceptual and empirical modeling of resilience, including the incorporation of disequilibria and the recalibration of key behavioral parameters on the basis of empirical data. Fourth, uses the results of a case study to illustrate some important issues relating to the subject.},

In this framework we will describe an empiricalapplication, in which the resilience and dynamics of the West-German labour market will beinvestigated.

	abstract = {In this work, we evaluate the exposure of Italian regions to the risk associated with the spread of {COVID}-19 through a two-step value chain approach. First, we estimate the degree of participation of Italian regions in a plurality of value chains linked to consumption, investment and exports. We distinguish between value chains aimed at satisfying essential needs and supply chains activated by needs characterized by a lower level of necessity in line with the restriction measures implemented by the Italian government. Second, we investigate the diﬀerent levels of contagion risk associated with each value chain and the possibility of reducing it through remote working. An exercise on policy measures implemented by the Italian government during Fall 2020 completes the paper. We ﬁnd that regions are aﬀected diﬀerently by lockdown policies because of their high heterogeneity in the degree of embeddedness within diﬀerent value chains and because their sectoral contributions to each of them. As a result, Italian regions are associated with very diverse potentials for mitigating contagion risk via remote working practices. Finally, we ﬁnd evidence that economic and contagion risks positively correlate in non essential value chains, while they are negatively associated in the production of medium-necessity and essential goods and services. In turn, strong lockdowns induce substantially diﬀerent trade-oﬀs across regions, depending on how regions participate to value chains.},

	abstract = {This Handbook aims to provide a guide for constructing and using composite indicators for policy makers, academics, the media and other interested parties. While there are several types of composite indicators, this Handbook is concerned with those which compare and rank country performance in areas such as industrial competitiveness, sustainable development, globalisation and innovation. The Handbook aims to contribute to a better understanding of the complexity of composite indicators and to an improvement of the techniques currently used to build them. In particular, it contains a set of technical guidelines that can help constructors of composite indicators to improve the quality of their outputs.},
