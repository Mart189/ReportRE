# Report for RE Class

Welcome to the repository for my Regional Economics report.

It was created to provide a glance over the process of writing my report.

In this repository, you will find the resources I used:
- The paper itself in both LaTeX and PDF format
- The graphs used and their Stata files
- Drafts and outlines

This repository may seem overkill for a simple work, but I find it an enjoyable addition to this learning experience (:
